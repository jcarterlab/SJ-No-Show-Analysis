# SJ-No-Show-Analysis

This notebook analyzes Saint James Hostel's no show bookings from January to June 2023 to assess their financial impact and determine whether anything can be inferred about which types of customers tend to not honour their booking.

Key takeaways include:

  1) no-shows as a % of bookings increased exponentially during the summer months  
  2) no-shows cost just over Â£6,000 at their height in May  
  3) weekend, multi-night, and multi-room bookings are more likely to be no-shows
